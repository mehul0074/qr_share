# QR Share Mobile (New)

This is a simplified mobile app created with the same base configuration as the working money-management app.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd mobile-new
npm install
```

2. Start the Expo development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your Android/iOS device.

## Configuration

This app uses the exact same base configuration as `C:\xampp\htdocs\money-management\client`:
- Same Expo SDK version (~54.0.7)
- Same React version (19.1.0)
- Same React Native version (0.81.4)
- Same app.json structure with newArchEnabled
- Same package.json structure

## Purpose

This is a test app to verify Expo Go connection works with the same configuration as your working app. It displays a simple welcome message with static text.
